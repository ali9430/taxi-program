# Taxi Program

This repository contains a very small command line taxi application written in Python. It lets you register riders and drivers, request rides and complete them. All data is stored in memory for demonstration purposes only.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+

## Usage

Run the program using:

```bash
python3 taxi_app.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to register riders and drivers or request rides.

This project is provided as a simple example inspired by ride hailing applications.
